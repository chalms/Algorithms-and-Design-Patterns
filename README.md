Algorithms-and-Design-Patterns
==============================

The following library was designed as a means to practice, record, and optimize the implementation of advanced data structures and programming problems.

This library is currently untested/unfinished, but it intends to include examples for the following: 

- Efficient solutions to 'hard' programming problems
- Advanced and custom data structures from the ground up 
- Implementation of various sorting algorithms 
- Client-server architecture using Socket I/O
- Map-reduce for distrubuted systems
- Multithreading, synchronization, resource sharing and process blocking
- String and bit manipulation
