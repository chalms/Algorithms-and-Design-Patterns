Algorithms-and-Design-Patterns
==============================

The following library was designed as a means to practice, record, and optimize the implementation of advanced data structures and programming problems.

This library is still unfinished, but it intends to include: 

### Hash's, Queues, Graphs, and Stacks

Advanced and custom data structures from the ground up. Solve complex problems 
with custom data structures. 

### Sorting Algorithms

Implementation of common sorting algorithms (Mergesort, Quicksort, etc..)

### Distributed Systems

Simple client-server architecture for distributed systems, as well has map-reduce implementation.  

### Resource Management

Simple multi-threading examples with a producer, consumer, and limited resource. 
This includes the singleton design pattern and synchronization examples with process blocking. 

### String and Bit manipulation

String and bit manipulation examples to help you solve the trickiest interview questions.

### Much more...
